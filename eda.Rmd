## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
coach <- read_csv("coach_data.csv") %>% 
  rename(num_msg = `Number of messages per week`)
```

```{r}
counts <- coach %>% 
  group_by(week_of_service) %>% 
  count(num_msg) %>% 
  mutate(total_msg = sum(n * num_msg)) %>% 
  distinct(total_msg)
counts

ggplot(counts, aes(x = week_of_service, y = total_msg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label= ifelse(week_of_service == 117,
                             as.character(week_of_service), "")), 
                nudge_x = 3, 
                color = "red")
```


```{r}
actives <- coach %>% 
  group_by(hashed_member_id) %>% 
  count(num_msg) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(n * num_msg)) %>% 
  distinct(total) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))
actives

top5_member <- actives %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  pull(hashed_member_id)

ggplot(actives, aes(x = total)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, aes(fill = "e3a42c")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

actives %>% 
  filter(total < 300) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, aes(fill = "e3a42c")) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

```{r}
top5_activity <- coach %>% 
  filter(hashed_member_id %in% top5_member) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_msg))

ggplot(top5_activity, aes(x = week_of_service, y = num_msg)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = hashed_member_id)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrBr")
